# Delete words and more

Change this text:

```text
You need to insert the key between the brackets to enter the castle
{}
üè∞
```

to this:

```text
You need to insert the key between the brackets to enter the castle
{This is the key: 42 üîë}
üè∞
```

Do this exercise multiple times, using different ways to jump.

The key is at the bottom of this file, very far away.

1. Method 1: Use `ctrl` + `d` to scroll down, take the key, then use `ctrl` + `u` to scroll up and enter the castle.
2. Method 2: Use `G` to get to the bottom, take the key, then use `gg` to get to the top and enter the castle.
3. Method 3: Place yourself in the door of the castle, use `G` to get to the bottom, take the key, use `ctrl` + `o` to get back exactly where you were before jumping, enter the castle.

*Note*: You now know that `G` is to get to the bottom of a file and `gg` to get to the top, you have learned that `d` is to delete, `y` to copy, what would happen if you mix them?

What would happen if you use `dG`? it will delete everything from where you are to the bottom of the file

What would happen if you use `dgg`? same thing but upwards

What would happen if you use `yG`? copy everything from where you are to the bottom (you can even do `gg` then `yG` to copy the whole content of a file)

What would happen if you use `ygg`? same thing but upwards
