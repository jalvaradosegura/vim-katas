# Delete lines

Change this text:

```text
Delete this whole line
Delete from here onwards:( :( :( :'( T_T
```

to this:

```text
Delete this whole line
Delete from here onwards
```

Place yourself anywhere at the first line.

Press `dd` to delete the whole line.

Go to the next line place yourself at the `:` and press `D`

*Note*: Notice how similar is to delete (`dd`) and copy (`yy`) a line.
