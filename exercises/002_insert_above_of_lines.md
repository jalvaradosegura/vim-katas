# Insert above of line

Change this text:

```javascript
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar
```

to this:

```javascript

var foo = 1;

var bar = 'a';

var foobar = foo + bar;
```

Place yourself anywhere at the first line.

Press `O`, then `escape`.

Repeat for each line.

*Pro tip*: after you are done with one line, you can then use `.` for the rest.
