# Delete words and more

Change this text:

```text
No no no no no no yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees no

yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes
yes yes
yes

(delete the content inside the parentheses below)
"delete the content inside the double quotes below"
'delete the content inside the quotes below'
```

to this:

```text
No no no no no no no


()
""
''
```

Place yourself anywhere at the first line.

Navigate to very long word `yes` using `w` or `e` or `l`.

Once you are anywhere within the big `yes` press `diw` and then press `x` once, to remove the extra space.
 
Place yourself anywhere within the big paragraph of yes.

Press `dip`.

Go to the line with parentheses, place yourself anywhere within the parentheses and press `di(`.

Go to the line with double quotes, place yourself anywhere within the double quotes and press `di"`.

Go to the line with single quotes, place yourself anywhere within the single quotes and press `di'`.

*Note*: notice how we can delete in the same way as we saw in the copy exercises but using a `d` (of delete) instead of a `y`.
