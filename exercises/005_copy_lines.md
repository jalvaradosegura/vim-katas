# Copy lines

Change this text:

```text
Copy this whole line below

Ignore me, I'm just using space
Copy this whole line above the previous line
```

to this:

```text
Copy this whole line below
Copy this whole line below

Copy this whole line above the previous line
Ignore me, I'm just using space
Copy this whole line above the previous line
```

Place yourself anywhere at the first line.

Press `yy` to copy, then `p` to paste the line below.

Go to the next line that starts with `Copy this...`, press `yy`, move to the previous line with `k` and press `P` to paste above.
