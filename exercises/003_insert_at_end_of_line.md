# Insert at the end of line

Change this text:

```javascript
var foo = 1
var bar = 'a'
var foobar = foo + bar
```

to this:

```javascript
var foo = 1;
var bar = 'a';
var foobar = foo + bar;
```

Place yourself anywhere at the first line.

Use `A` to insert at the end of the line, add `;`, press `escape`.

Repeat for each line.

*Pro tip*: after you are done with one line, you can then use `.` for the rest.
